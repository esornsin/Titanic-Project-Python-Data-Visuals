# Titanic-Project-Python-Data-Visuals
This project was created while doing the Udemy course: Learning Python for Data Analysis and Visualizations.

The purpose of this project was to retrieve data from a .csv file, and answer questions using visualizations to interpret the data. 
Graphs were created to see the amount of men to women aboard the ship.
How many of the passengers on board were children.

Other questions involved the correlation of class and survivorship, as well as did the passengers cabin determine if they were more or less likely to survive the crash.
